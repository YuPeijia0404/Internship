# Data Sampling
## Key points
* Unbiased(equal chance)
* Representative
### Simple Random Sampling
* Each member of the subset has an equal probability of being chosen
* Unbiased sample but may not be representative
### Convenience Sampling
* Usually biased
### Systematic Sampling
* Choose a starting point of random
* Depends on whether the data set has a pattern
### Cluster Sampling
* Devided into clusters and then implement Simple Random Sampling
* May lead to bias or non-representativeness when the clusters are different from each other
### Stratified Sampling
* Take a random sample according to the percentage of each group
### MultiStage Sampling
* Each stage has a kind of a sample
